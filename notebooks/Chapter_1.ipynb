        "The van der Waals equation is given by\n",
        "$$\\left(P + \\frac{a}{\\overline{V}^2} \\right)(\\overline{V}^2-b) = RT$$\n",
        "Where $a$ is the strength of molecular attraction, $b$ is proportional to the volume of molecules, $R$ is the gas constant, P is the pressure, and $\\overline{V}$ is the molar volume of the fluid.\n",
        "\n",
        "This highlights interactions of imperfect molecules in a fluid. This is kinda like an \"unideal gas law\". However, this is just an approximation.\n",
        "\n",
        "A more exact way to give this is in terms of intermolecular potential energy $U(r)$ which results from two molecules interacting at seperation $r$. The intermolecular force is then given as $F(r) = -\\frac{dU}{dr}$, or equivalently, $U(r)=\\int_r^\\infty F(r) dr$. Intuitively, this can be thought of as the work required to fight against intermolecular force to bring two bodies from distance $\\infty$ to $r$ [source](https://app.ph.qmul.ac.uk/wiki/_media/ajm:teaching:intermolecular_forces_angyan_part1.pdf)\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, we want to characterize the potential function $U$ in as few parameters as possible, often using: $\\sigma$ to denote where $U(r) = 0$ and the seperation $r_m$ where $U(r) = -\\epsilon$, a minimum. We graph $U(r)$ and $F(r)$ below using a simplified model known as the Leonard-Jones Potential\n",
        "\n",
        "It is helpful to have some sense of approximate magnitude. Using Trouton's rule, we can say that $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} \\approx 10RT_b$ where $R$ is the gas constant and $T_b$ is an arbitrary boiling point. We can take $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = 10N_A\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ to be the force of seperation at $r_m$. Thus, $\\epsilon$ can be given as $2kT_b$ where $k$ is the equilibrium constant.\n"
